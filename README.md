# subclass-dance-party
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

# Subclass Dance Party
An exploration in polymorphism and inheritance.

# High Level Goals of this Sprint
Master subclassing in JavaScript
Use JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS to add unique effects to your application
Be focused and deadline oriented around design choices
What is polymorphism?
When constructing applications, it is often the case that you will need to construct objects that share common methods or traits. Dancers, for example, all display individual unique traits, however they also share the ability to dance, to stop dancing, and to line up. By creating dancers that are subclasses of a Dancer class, you can exhibit individuality while allowing your dancers to inherit useful methods from their superclass. This ability of the Dancer class to manifest in various subclass forms is polymorphism.

# Important Files
dancefloor.html a dancer-indiscriminate stage.
src contains dancer.js and blinkyDancer.js with some code that you'll refactor and then extend with new types of dancers.
spec contains a few tests--you'll be adding more.
SpecRunner.html runs the tests.
